1. example of network topology in case of terminal hidden. In 802.11, descirbe at lease two methods to avoid collision?
2. Describe OLSR (w.r.t link state flood)
3. 
T-MAC advantage
S-MAC briefly explain
Why we need multi-hop in WSN even when directly transmission is possible?
4. what thing must consider when we design one DTN routing. What is the difference between DTN and ad-hoc network, and transditional routing. 




2018
1.a S-MAC briefly explain
1.b T-MAC advantage

2. Which thing consider when we create Ad-hoc routing algorithm
( For example, difference Ad-hoc routing and Tradition routing )
